# Capstone-II
## Purpose of the system
This system is developed for an entity, which has a team of employees,
all of whome have various tasks assigned to them. The system gives
different levels of clearance to admin, as opposed to other users.
Admin may add new users to the system, and each time a new user is added
it is updated in the user.txt file. Tasks can then be assigned to each user,
and the tasks will also be saved into the tasks.txt file. This file will
then contain data pertaining to when the task was assigned, the task description,
whether it has been completed and the due date. The data can be updated and changed 
at any time. There is also functionality to generate reports, which will 
tell us percentage of tasks completed, how many tasks are assigned to each user
etc.
## Why the system is useful
In an entity with a large work force it becomes challenging to stay on top of
what each member has been assigned, as well as whether the team is completing their
tasks. Thus it is super useful for management to keep a track record, as well as 
keeping more junior members accountable to their work.
